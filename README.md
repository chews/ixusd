# IXUSD Stablecoin & Exchange Platform Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive 10-week project plan outlines the development of IXUSD, a collateralized stablecoin on the RWAP Group's Optimism-based Layer 2 chain with native precompiles (competing with XRPL-EVM), followed by integration into a specialized exchange platform for ultra-high net worth individuals. The stablecoin will be backed by traditional financial assets ($250M bond + $100M equity) with 175% overcollateralization, implementing patterns from established protocols like DAI while adapting for real-world asset collateralization.
